## Pre-rendering

By default Next.js pre-renders all pages by server side rendering - pre-generating the finished HTML page so that it is fully populated and sent back to the client. This means it also sends back all styling and JS that belongs to the page and React hydration (making the page interactive) begins once loaded.

## Two forms of pre-rendering

- SG - Static Generation
- SSR - Server Side Generation

Next.js allows you to **pick a rendering strategy on a per-route basis.** You can statically generate one part of your website and server-side render the other. That could be an advantage over other static site generators like which mainly focuses on just static, as Next.js covers more use cases in the same app.
