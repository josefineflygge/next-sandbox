# **How does Next.js enhance React apps?**

React is a third party package you add to your frontend project, with **client side JavaScript** mainly focused on building component based UI:s. While Next.js is a framework that offers a lot of features that makes building large scale production ready apps easier. It builds upon and **enhances React** with new capabilities and is said to give more guidance in how to structure your project. Next also includes core features out of the box that you would need to add separately for React, such as routing, authentication, server side code etc.

# **Key Next.js concepts**

## Server side rendering (SSR)

In **React**, all the rendering is happening on the client (CSR). Therefor the initial HTML-document sent from the server to the client is mostly "empty". This can be a problem for apps that rely on **Search Enginge Optimization (SEO)**, since crawlers interpreting the site will only see the initial generated HTML, not containing the React app. It could also result in a generally worse loading experience, and affect the performance metric First Contentful Paint (FCP) performance score -- the time required to display the first DOM element.

In **Next** the page is prepared on the server instead of the client, on request or even at build time. The finished page is served fully populated to the client. Since data fetching only begins once the JS is executed in the CSR case, SSR could lead to a smaller bundle being loaded in the client.

## File based routing

SPA:s like React give the user the illusion of having multiple pages as the app updates the URL on link-klick without making another server request for a document. (lika React Router f.ex.) In **Next.js** the router is file-system based, where pages and routes are defined with files and folders. I'ts inuitive and supports nested and dynamic routes etc.

## "A full-stack framework for React.js"

With Next you have the possibility to add BE/server-side code and build an entire API within your Next/React app.
