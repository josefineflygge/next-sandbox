Api routes are URLs that don't return pages (HTML) put instead provide a (REST) API.Requests are typically not sent by entering a browser url but via JS code. This lets us define our own API endpoints as part of our Next app. They are server-side only bundles and you can execute any server side code here that won't increase your client-side bundle size at it's not included and therefor not exposed to visitors.

## Use cases

For new projects, you can build your entire API with API Routes. If you have an existing API, you do not need to forward calls to the API through an API Route. Some other use cases for API Routes are:

- Masking the URL of an external service (e.g. /api/secret instead of https://company.com/secret-url)
- Using Environment Variables on the server to securely access external services

## How

Files are placed in the pages folder in a "api" folder. We don't export a react component from these special routes, but next will execute the function on incoming requests to _ `/api/<name-of-file>_ .

```js
function handler(req, res) {
  if (req.method === "POST") {
    const { data } = req.body; // Do some action like saving to a database
    res.status(201).json({ message: "Sucess!", data: data });
  }
  //...
}

export default handler;
```

Inside Component:

```js
const res = await fetch("/api/<API-ROUTE-NAME>", {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify(body),
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
});
```

## Dynamic API routes

API routes support dynamic routes. For example, the API route _pages/api/post/[pid]_:

```js
export default function handler(req, res) {
  const { pid } = req.query;
  res.end(`Post: ${pid}`);
}
```
