Some data doesn't need to be or can't be pre-rendered, so pre-fetching data for a page generation might not be required. "Traditional" client-side data fetching. e.g. the React useEffect-hook with fetch, is fine too. Or combining client-side and pre-fetching. useEffect executes after the whole component is evaluated and rendered (and painted).

**Examples**

- Frequently updated data
- Highly user-specific data
- Partial data (e.g. data that's only used on a part of a page)

## useSWR

[useSWR](https://swr.vercel.app/docs/getting-started) is a Next created custom React hook for simplifying data fetching. It is a recommended way to fetch data on the client side. It takes in two arguments: a data identifier (api url) and a fetcher function (any async function that returns the data, like fetch or axios etc).

It can also be good for for example caching or re-fetching. For example it provides the ability to

- Refetch on window focus (switch tabs), internet reconnect refetch, revalidation, polling, automatic error retry, etc.
- You can easily feed your SSR/ISR/SSG data into SWR, so the data is still pre-rendered, but can update in the browser over time.

```js
import useSWR from "swr";

const fetcher = (...args) => fetch(...args).then((res) => res.json());

function ProfilePage() {
  const { data, error } = useSWR("/api/profile-data", fetcher);
  // ...
}
```
