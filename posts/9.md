# Standard build

```js
`next build`;
```

Next produces an optimized production bundles and a server-side app.

- You can't take the output of a next build and put it on some static host
- Pages are pre-rendered (if possible) but Node server is required for api-routes, server side pages and page revalidations.
- You need a node server for running the output next build gives you
- When you deploy that ouput you need to deploy it onto a host able to run node
- Re-deploying needed if code changes or you don't use revalidations and need page updates

# Full Static Build

```js
`next export`;
```

- Also produces an optimized production version of your app, but a 100% static application (HTML, CSS, JS), no server side code, no need of node server.
- Doesn't work if your app uses API routes, SSR pages or wants page revalidations etc.
- Need to re-deploy for all code and content changes
