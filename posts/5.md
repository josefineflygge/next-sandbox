With server side rendering, pages are pre-generated after deployment, **whenever a request is made for the page**. This can be useful when you need to pre-render for every request OR you need access to the request object.

An example is a user specific page - you don't know which users we have or have access to f.ex. cookies before the client request is made. Or a page that relies heavy on real time data.

For dynamic paths - no getStaticPaths is needed here (as opposed to SG) since no pre-generated pages.

### getServerSideProps()

An async function exported from a page component that **"prepares" the props for your component**, rendering that page on each request. The page will use the data returned from this function.

```js
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  // const { params, req, res } = context;
  return {
    props: {
      userName: "Jane",
    },
  };
}
```
