Pages in Next.js are essentially just components located in the "pages" folder. A file in the root of the pages folder dictates the name of the route, alternatively a named folder with an index file.

By nestling folders and files **nested paths** can be created.

**Dynamic pages** can be achieved by wrapping the name with square brackets, when there's a need for the same kind of page for different data.

There is also the "catch all" paths made available as an array of values.

```js
// Dynamic page/path
[<id>].js

// Catch all path
[...slug]

/blog/whatever/you/want --> query: {slug: ["whatever", "you", "want"]}

```

### **useRouter**

A hook that returns a router object with different properties. Dynamic segments can be accessed through it. Some of the properties are **pathname** -- the infered path, and **query** -- the concrete path for the dynamic path placeholder

```js
const { pathname, query } = useRouter(); // projects/[id],  {id: "123"}
```

### **Link-component**

The **Link**-component extends the HTML **a**-element to provide prefetching and client-side navigation between routes. Client-side navigation means that the page transition happens using JavaScript -- to control page transitions without a full reload. So internal state for example is kept.

Link expects a _href_ attribute to be set, which can be the route path name as string or an object. It also supports some special functionality like **prefetch** which allows automatic prefetching of page data when hovering over a Link.

You can also navigate programatically by using the object returned from **useRouter** object and executing:

```js
// Allows going back in the browser as it pushes a new history entry
router.push;

// Does not allow going back as it replaces the current history entry
router.replace;
```

_Next.js 13 introduced the new **App Router** with new features and conventions. The new Router is available in the app directory and co-exists with the pages directory. [Read more here](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/app-router-migration)._
