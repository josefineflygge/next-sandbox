# Head

Next exposes a built-in component for appending elements to the head (html <head>)of the page. An example:

```js
<Head>
	<meta name="viewport" width=device-width" />
    <title>Your page title</title>
</Head>
```

In the case of multiple Head-elements: for example in a layout and a page the layout is wrapping, the same elements inside are merged, the latest element is used. You can apply a general title for example in a layout and it will get overridden if a page has specific head data.

# document.js file

The document.js is a special file placed in the root of the pages folder and represents the root component inside of the body section in your html document.

Reasons for overriding the default document could be:

- Setting the lang attribute
- Adding html content/elements outside of the application component tree, for example for using with portals

```js
import Document, { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from "next/document";

class MyDocument extends Document {
  render() {
    return (
      <Html lang="en">
               
        <Head />       <body>
          {" "}
             
          <Main /> 
          <NextScript />
        </body> 
      </Html>
    );
  }
}

export default MyDocument;
```

# Next Images

Next gives the option to optimize image usage in your by using the built-in **NextImage** and the component requires the following properties: src, width, height, and alt.

```js
import Image from "next/image";
//...
<Image src={`/${image}`} alt={title} width={240} height={100} />;
```

Next will create multiple versions of the image on the fly when requests are coming in optimized for the OS and device sized that are making the requests.

- Width and height determine the dimensions to be fetched
- The images will be cached and used for similar devices for subsequent requests unitl the expiration is reached. When a request is made that matches a cached but expired file, the expired image is served stale immediately. Then the image is optimized again in the background and saved to the cache with the new expiration date.
- Images are lazy-loaded by default, aka loaded when visible
